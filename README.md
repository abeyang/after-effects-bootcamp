# After Effects Bootcamp

This was created for Gracepoint's After Effects Best Practices class (2013). In this repository, you'll find:

- tutorials that teach certain key concepts of After Effects
- all the original assets for you to use as you learn the concepts
- final Premiere + After Effects files (to use as comparison)
- final video (with special effects and all)

Original project template taken from [abeyang/video-project-template][1]

## Getting Started

1. Go through [Art of Motion Graphics presentation][2]
2. Have Premiere and After Effects installed (CC preferred; CS6 would be next best option)
3. [Download][3] and unzip this repo
4. Install the fonts inside `Extras/Fonts/`
5. [Understand how the assets are managed][4]
6. Open (AE project file..)

## Tutorials

Each tutorial teaches a few key concepts, and it increases with difficulty. They'll also be building on top of each other, so it's important to do this in order. Finally, each tutorial ends with a hands-on lesson.

By the end of the tutorials, you would have recreated the **final video**.

All tutorials are located inside `Extras/Tutorials/`:

1. Keyframing + Text Animation Basics
	- Animation principles
	- Keyframes
	- Text animation
	- After Effects Interface
2. Animation Properties
	- Opacity/Position/Scale
	- Pre-composition
	- Corner Pins
3. Your Turn
4. Animation Curves + Trackers
	- Animation Principles
	- Linear vs. easy-ease
	- Understanding the animation graph
	- Null objects and trackers
5. Nesting Layers and Masks
	- Importing assets from Photoshop
6. Motion-tracking + 3D transforms
7. **EXTRA** Premiere and After Effects
	- Rendering out from AE
	- Workflow between Premiere and AE
		- Dynamic Linking
		- Standards and Best Practices
8. **EXTRA** Exporting Videos with Transparent Backgrounds

## Misc

All images have been optimized by ImageOptim; all video footages have been down-sampled to 720p @ 6kbps. All this was done in order to save space, so that it can fit under Github's 1GB/repo (and 100MB/file) limit.

## Tips + Good Habits

- separating dimensions
- KISS
	- start with basic keyframes
	- when possible, use curves instead of adding keyframes
	- fewer keyframes = better (generally)

## Notes to self (to delete)

- Before class
	- make sure people have *at least* CS6 and up
	- make sure they've downloaded project files beforehand
- **Questions**
	- would it be better to print out entire tutorial and hand out?
- Lesson 1 (25 min lecture; 18 min do-it-yourself)
	- explain why we're doing this exercise (personally didn't know you can do this to chunk of text; used to split out the text by itself)
	- maybe good to ask how people in audience would do this, before giving my example
	- tip: good to have tunnel vision. A lot of stuff are "advanced features" -- don't need to know majority of what they do.
