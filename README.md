# After Effects Bootcamp

This was created for Gracepoint's After Effects Best Practices class (2013). In this repository, you'll find:

- tutorials that teach certain key concepts of After Effects
- all the original assets for you to use as you learn the concepts
- final Premiere + After Effects files (to use as comparison)
- final video (with special effects and all)

Original project template taken from [abeyang/video-project-template][1]

## Getting Started

1. Have Premiere and After Effects installed (CC preferred; CS6 would be next best option)
2. [Download][2] and unzip this repo
3. Install the fonts inside `Extras/Fonts/`
4. [Understand how the assets are managed][3]
5. Open (AE project file..)

## Tutorials

Each tutorial teaches a few key concepts, and it increases with difficulty. They'll also be building on top of each other, so it's important to do this in order. Finally, each tutorial ends with a hands-on lesson.

By the end of the tutorials, you would have recreated the **final video**.

All tutorials are located inside `Extras/Tutorials/`:

1. Basics of animation
	- Animation principles
	- Keyframes
	- Linear vs. easy-ease
	- Text animation
2. Understanding After Effects
	- Composition principles
	- Previewing in AE
	- Exporting (CC and pre-CC use different methods)
	- Workflow between Premiere and AE
3. Basic shapes + lines 
	- Shapes
	- Lines (not as intuitive as you'd think)
	- Animating lines + strokes
4. Animation curves
5. Precomps and masks
6. Motion-tracking + 3D transforms
