# After Effects Bootcamp

This was created for Gracepoint's After Effects Best Practices class (2013). In this repository, you'll find:

- tutorials that teach certain key concepts of After Effects
- all the original assets for you to use as you learn the concepts
- final Premiere + After Effects files (to use as comparison)
- final video (with special effects and all)

Original project template taken from [abeyang/video-project-template][1]

## Getting Started

1. Go through [Art of Motion Graphics presentation][2]
2. Have Premiere and After Effects installed (CC preferred; CS6 would be next best option)
3. [Download][3] and unzip this repo
4. Install the fonts inside `Extras/Fonts/`
5. [Understand how the assets are managed][4]
6. Open (AE project file..)

## Tutorials

Each tutorial teaches a few key concepts, and it increases with difficulty. They'll also be building on top of each other, so it's important to do this in order. Finally, each tutorial ends with a hands-on lesson.

By the end of the tutorials, you would have recreated the **final video**.

All tutorials are located inside `Extras/Tutorials/`:

1. Keyframing + Text Animation Basics
	- Animation principles
	- Keyframes
	- ||Linear vs. easy-ease||
	- Text animation
2. Understanding After Effects
	- Composition principles
	- Previewing in AE
	- Exporting (CC and pre-CC use different methods)
	- Workflow between Premiere and AE
3. Basic shapes + lines 
	- Shapes
	- Lines (not as intuitive as you'd think)
	- Animating lines + strokes
4. Animation curves
5. Precomps and masks
6. Motion-tracking + 3D transforms

## Misc

All images have been optimized by ImagOptim; all video footages have been down-sampled to 720p @ 6kbps. All this was done in order to save space, so that it can fit under Github's 1GB/repo limit.

## Tips + Good Habits

- separating dimensions
- KISS
