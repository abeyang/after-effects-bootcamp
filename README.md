# After Effects Bootcamp

This was created for Gracepoint's After Effects Best Practices class (2013). In this repository, you'll find:

- tutorials that teach certain key concepts of After Effects
- all the original assets for you to use as you learn the concepts
- final Premiere + After Effects files (to use as comparison)
- final video (with special effects and all)

Original project template taken from [abeyang/video-project-template][1]

## Getting Started

1. Install the fonts inside `Extras/Fonts/`
2. [Understand how the assets are managed][2]
3. (to be continued...)

## Tutorials

Each tutorial teaches a few key concepts, and it increases with difficulty. They'll also be building on top of each other, so it's important to do this in order. Finally, each tutorial ends with a hands-on lesson.

By the end of the tutorials, you would have recreated the **final video**.

All tutorials are located inside `Extras/Tutorials/`:

1. Premiere to After Effects workflow
2. Basics of Animation
	- Principles of Animation
	- Keyframes
	- Linear vs. easy-ease
	- Text animation
3. Basic Shapes (animating lines and strokes)
