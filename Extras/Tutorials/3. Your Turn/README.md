# Your Turn

There's no set lesson plan, except that it's time to to take what you've learned in lessons 1 and 2, and recreate **120-nodt-vfx**.

I'll leave up to you how you want the text to appear, but "devotions from june" should appear by words, whereas "zero" should appear by characters. Here are some things I've used, in case you want to play around with it:

- Loading indicator: shifts to right and fades out
- Book icon: used the transition effect, "Linear Wipe"
- Text: used text animation properties "opacity" and "blur"

## Tips

- Think about what's going on and what you want to accomplish.
- Break it down to their parts
- Group (pre-comp) the things that make the most sense

## Conclusion

Once your'e done, you'll notice again that your UI will "slide" above the original footage. Again, let's not worry about that for now -- if there's time after the *next* lesson, we'll tackle that.
