# Animation Curves + Trackers

## Intro

Before you start, watch this [commercial from Coin][1]. Did you see how the credit cards pop out of the "Coin"? We're going to try to emulate that, and add a slight *Minority Report* / *Ironman* twist to it.

**Mea Culpa**: This wasn't filmed with proper trackers...

## Animation Principles

- things "look good" when it's closer to perceived reality
- Finding Nemo: ocean made realistic first, before it was "dumbed down"

## Main Body

- Linear vs. easy-ease
- Understanding the animation graph
- Null objects and trackers
	- [More information on trackers][2]
	- duplicate Precomp (3) and rename it to Precomp (4)
	- loading: 07:06
		- from 09:14 on, manual track (just the attach points)

## If There's Time...

Go back to lessons 2-3 and--
- Add trackers to the Slab, and apply the keyframes to the UI. Right now the UI just "slides" on top of the Slab (as Jasper can't hold it perfectly still). This will make it feel more realistic.
- Smooth out the animation keyframes (where it makes sense).

Track Point 1 was rather difficult. Had to make sure the region didn't hit the other dots.

Animated it forward and backwards.

Need a second corner pin, to re-calibrate!
