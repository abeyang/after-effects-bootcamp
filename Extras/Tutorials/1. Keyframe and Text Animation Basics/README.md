# Keyframing + Text Animation Basics

## Intro

Watch the **Designed by Apple** video under `Examples/`. Even though the it's about what Apple looks for in its products, I think a majority of it is true to what animation and effects can do for videos (ok, so it doesn't "enhance each life it touches").

Now, there's *a lot* of things that can be done with After Effects (AE). There's a lot of one-off stuff that you can do, and there's typically a dime-a-dozen tutorials out there on the web that teaches how to pull each one of them off. Thus, this bootcamp will *not* cover these concepts in AE:

- Color correction
- Green screen / keying
- 99.9% of the filters out there
- Lightsabers

Instead, we'll be covering principles in animation, along with some touches of minor compositing techniques. For this lesson, we'll be dealing with *keyframes* and *text animation*.

## Getting Started

This bootcamp assumes that the student has some working knowledge of After Effects. I'll try to cover parts of the interface that I'll think will be useful, but for the most part, I won't talk about it. Please brush up on your [basic After Effects knowledge][1] if you need to do so.

Before you start with the After Effects project, make sure you look at the **final video**, so that you know what you're getting yourself into.

Open up **Visual Effects.aep** under `Project/` and find **200-voice-vfx** under **COMPS/Lesson 1/**. You should see something like this:

It's Jasper with the text that he'll eventually say. What we want to do is animate the block of text, and sync it to words he's saying.

## Interface

- Layers + timeline
	- keyframes (clock icon)
	- choosing specific properties
- RAM Preview
	- beginning / end
