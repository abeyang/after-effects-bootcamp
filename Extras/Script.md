EXT. FOUNTAIN AREA - DAY

HERO, sitting next to FRIEND 1 and FRIEND 2 at a table.

HERO
> I'm here to tell you about a revolutionary new device. Has this scenario ever happened to you? You're sitting at a table -- very much like this one -- and your friend says--

FRIEND 1
> (Excited.) Hey, let's share from our DTs... from 6 months ago!

HERO
> Now you're at a bind. 

FRIEND 2 pulls out his DT journal

HERO (cont'd)
> The DT journal that you have on you only covers to at most a month back.

FRIEND 2 pulls out an iPad

HERO (cont'd)
> And the iPad and all other tablets have that nasty glare.

FRIEND 2
> Hey, can we sit inside?

HERO
> (Laughs sarcastically.) Don't be rude.

FRIEND 2 is about to pull out his laptop

HERO (cont'd)
> And don't you even think about pulling out that laptop.
> (To camera with a smile) It's not kosher.

> So you're at a bind, and what do you do?
> Fortunately, there's a new device.
> (Pulls out SLAB from backpack) It's called "The Slab."
> I can easily choose from my past DTs -- (Gently shakes SLAB horizontally. **DT journals fly out**.) -- going back months, or even years.

> (Turns SLAB around) Let's see here-- 
> (**Flicks DTs away**)
> Don't need this, don't need that. Ah, here (**finger-drags the right DT, slides it into SLAB**), the month of June.
