## (100) EXT. FOUNTAIN AREA - DAY

HERO, sitting next to FRIEND 1 and FRIEND 2 at a table.

HERO
> I'm here to tell you about a revolutionary new device. Has this scenario ever happened to you? You're sitting at a table -- very much like this one -- and your friend says--

FRIEND 1
> (Excited.) Hey, let's share from our DTs... from 6 months ago!

HERO
> Now you're at a bind. 

FRIEND 2 pulls out his DT journal

HERO (cont'd)
> The DT journal that you have on you only covers to at most a month back.

FRIEND 2 pulls out an iPad

HERO (cont'd)
> And the iPad and all other tablets have that nasty glare.

FRIEND 2
> Hey, can we sit inside?

HERO
> (Laughs sarcastically.) Don't be rude.

FRIEND 2 is about to pull out his laptop

HERO (cont'd)
> And don't you even think about pulling out that laptop.
> (To camera with a smile) It's not kosher.

> So you're at a bind, and what do you do?
> Fortunately, there's a new device.
> (Pulls out SLAB from backpack) It's called "The Slab."
> I can easily choose from my past DTs -- (Gently shakes SLAB horizontally. **DT journals fly out**.) -- going back months, or even years. Now, let's see here-- 
> (**Flicks DTs away**)
> Don't need this, don't need that. Ah, here (**finger-drags the right DT, slides it into SLAB**)-- the month of June.

> While this is loading up, it's a good time to talk about its digital assistant. Just like Ironman has Jarvis, Apple has Siri, Google has Google Now, the Slab has--

C.U. of interface on SLAB (O.S. of HERO). **Shows 0 DTs from month of June**.

SLAB
> You have zero DTs. (Sarcastically) I am so enamored by your spirituality.

HERO
> (To camera) 
> --Barnabus.

## (200) INT. DINING TABLE

HERO is alone, sitting at the table, with SLAB in hand.

HERO
> Let's demonstrate one of the bigger features in Slab. While people gripe about the iPad's on-screen keyboard, and Surface is basically unusable unless you shell out another $150 for its keyboard, the Slab does away with that completely. It's completely driven by voice-recognition.

SLAB
> Would you like to *finally* enter your first DT entry, O Spiritual One?

HERO
> Quiet you.
> (Raises SLAB closer to mouth) OK Barney, show me today's text.

C.U. of SLAB. **Pulls up Psalm 23**.

HERO
> (To camera) Ok, I just finished reading. Now, check out its superb voice-recognition. 
> (To SLAB) OK Barney, input new DT entry. 
> (**Animation effects of HERO talking**) As I think about today's text--

Animation shows: "As I think about today's *Taco Trucks*"

HERO
> No, I said text. No, scratch that--

Animation writes exactly as it hears: "No, I said text. No, scratch that"

HERO
> No, delete. No, stop. Aauuuggh!

Animation writes exactly as it hears.

## (300) INT. KITCHEN

HERO has an apron donned.

HERO
> So here's another familiar scenario. You're trying to cook something delicious--
> (shows laptop and cutting board) and you have your laptop out on one side, and a cutting board on another. But why have two, when you can have both -- in one!

Camera pans to reveal SLAB lying on counter.

HERO
> OK Barney, get me the recipe of French Onion Soup.

Overhead shot of HERO on cutting board, ready to slice an onion. **Interface reveals tips of how not to cut oneself. HERO scrolls up and down.** HERO starts chopping.

Cut to direct shot of HERO. He's still chopping, but action is done O.S.

HERO
> (From looking down at cutting board to the camera) Can you do this with *your* tablet or laptop? I think not--

Extra hard chop. HERO bites lip. Just when he's about to scream, cut!

## (400) EXT. FOUNTAIN AREA - DAY

HERO is sitting in the same place as in the beginning, next to FRIEND 1 and FRIEND 2.

HERO
> So, in case you're not sold yet, the Slab comes with--

Shot of SLAB inside the cafe, with **text flying in**.

HERO (V.O. cont'd)
> - All the DT text
> - wifi and 4G
> - Built-in GPS, weather forecast, pedometer
> - .. and it has a very nice handle 

Cut back to HERO

HERO (cont'd)
> Best of all, it's completely hands free!

HERO reveals bandaged hand.

HERO
> OK Barney, start new journal entry. Yesterday, Richard got really mad at me because I poked fun at how ugly he looks. 

Zoom out to reveal his two friends sitting next to him, looking at him...

HERO (cont'd)
> Man, why is he so sensitive? And superficial? He just needs to chill out...
> And oh, my other friend, Cliff--

FRIEND 1
> My name is Ryan.

HERO
> Sure it is, Kneckle. Anyways, he just goes on and on about how he doesn't give a rip.
> (Pause) No, I said rip. No, delete that.

(500) Fade out. Show "Slab" title, with some information about After Effects Best Practices.

HERO (V.O., cont'd)
> No, scratch that. Select-all and delete. No, you're doing it wring. Ctrl+A delete. Shift-ctrl-delete. No. Force-close app. Reset tablet. Stop. Power down completely. (Sighs.)
